Recently, I've created a Java wrapper for the CLI tool named <a href="https://github.com/bbc/audiowaveform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC AudioWaveform</a>.
<br/> <br>
The tool is super cool for audio-waveform-generation and audio-summary-information-extraction. 
I used the wrapper in one of my personal projects in order to extract waveform information from audio files as JSON.
