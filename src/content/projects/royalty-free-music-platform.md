As a passionate musician and producer, I have been looking for a way to make my music available on a platform for content creators.
Since I like programming and trying out new things, I decided to start the development my own platform for royalty free music in 2020.
<br/> <br>
After a planning phase I started with the backend in Java. I decided to use a microservice oriented approach to ensure high scalability and flexibility. I also like this approach because it supports the principle of Separation of Concerns, where each service has its own function.
Currently, most of the backend functionality is ready for the first release, but the frontend is still under development.
<br/> <br>
As soon as the platform is ready I will be happy to present it.

PS: I also have to produce a lot of music. Lol.
