Within the scope of a study project, me and three fellow students developed a digital learning system for students. The system offers students the possibility to deepen their knowledge by creating index cards. These index cards can then be queried in an interactive quiz mode. Through a dashboard students can see their current learning progress. 
<br/> <br>
Another feature of the system is the Live Quiz. In the live quiz, students can work together on index cards in real time. This mode is especially suitable for lectures, where the lecturer want to check the knowledge of the students.
<br/> <br>
The system also implements a special phase-based learning technique to support the students in their learning.
<br/> <br>
In 2018 our team received for this project the "Award for an outstanding study project" at the Technical University of Applied Sciences in Ingolstadt.
